Complete the two partial SystemVerilog RTL files:

- sources/axi_top.sv : an AXI4-Lite slave peripheral that exposes a small memory-mapped register space.
- sources/csr_regfile.sv : an internal register file implementing data registers + CSR registers with per-register access permissions.

Read the specifications placed in /workdir/docs/Specification.md to construct and properly integrate the modules.
The design must be synthesizable, parameterized, and robust to AXI-Lite backpressure.
